# DistortoCorrect Stitcher

DistortoCorrect Stitcher is a tool designed to accurately stitch image tiles with distortion correction for microscopy. This repository contains a Jupyter notebook, `distortCorrectStitcher.ipynb`, which provides a full workflow for stitching and distortion correction. The details of the algorithm and implementation can be found in our forthcoming publication.

## Features
- **Input Format**: Image tiles in float32 format with dimensions `[tile, color, y, x]`. Each tile should be `2048 x 2048` pixels. Additionally, the global positions should be provided in an `n x 2` array, where each row contains the `y` and `x` coordinates (top-left corner) of each tile.
- **Output Format**: An assembled TIFF file in the `tyx` format, compatible with Fiji (ImageJ) for further analysis.

## Usage
The `distortCorrectStitcher.ipynb` notebook provides a complete stitching process with distortion correction.
